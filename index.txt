5:T660,<p>With over 11 years of experience as a Software Engineer, I am driven by a deep passion for learning and a commitment to continuous improvement. This passion fuels everything I do—whether it's tackling new technologies, leading teams through complex challenges, or mentoring the next generation of developers. I thrive in environments where innovation meets collaboration, and I am always eager to take on new challenges that push both my skills and my team’s abilities to new heights.</p>
  <p>Throughout my career, I've had the opportunity to work on a broad range of projects, leveraging a diverse set of technologies, including:</p></br>
  <ul class="about-list">
    <li><strong>Frontend:</strong> HTML, CSS, JavaScript, TypeScript, React React Native, Next.JS, Svelte, SolidJS, Tailwind, Bootstrap, Material UI, NPM, Yarn, PNPM, Turborepo, Storybook.</li>
    <li><strong>Backend:</strong> Node.js, Express, Java, Spring Boot, GraphQL, RESTful APIs, Prisma, PostgreSQL, MySQL, Redux.</li>
    <li><strong>Testing:</strong> Jest, React Testing Library, Enzyme, JUnit, Mockito.</li>
    <li><strong>DevOps:</strong> Docker, Kubernetes, Jenkins, GitHub Actions, Azure, Heroku, Netlify, Vercel.</li>
    </ul></br>
    <p>As a Tech Lead, I take pride in not only solving complex technical problems but also in building high-performing, cohesive teams. I believe in creating environments where people feel empowered to share ideas, learn from each other, and push the boundaries of what's possible. My approach is hands-on and collaborative, ensuring that both the code and the people behind it are always moving forward.</p>8:T721,I've had the absolute pleasure of having Daniel as my software development mentor for the last two years. When we started working together, I didn't know a single line of code. Since then, he has helped me work my way through Javascript, React, Bootstrap, Agile methodologies, and more. He is a phenomenal mentor who adjusts his teaching and explanations well to any kind of learning preference. He provided clear and concise answers to my questions, and spent as much time as needed with me on different topics and concepts. If I could not wrap my head around something, he would find another way to explain it, or find resources to aid in my learning. He supplied me with a plethora of learning materials geared towards my preference of learning style- and spent time peer programming with me and focusing on topics I was struggling with, or had a passion to learn. He worked with me to define a capstone project that piqued my interest, and assisted in moving the project along. When I was frustrated or felt defeated, he always had the perfect approach to setting me back on track and in the right mindset. He is constantly encouraging and patient, and has dedicated a vast amount of time and resources on my learning adventure. He celebrated wholeheartedly each and every one of my 'win's with me - whether it was completing a major certificate, solving a difficult problem, finishing a project, or landing my first job. With his tutelage, after two years of learning, I accepted a Junior Developer job at a phenomenal company. Even though I'm now a full-time developer, Daniel is still there as a resource for me to reach out to when I am stuck on a problem, or need some words of advice. I would highly recommend Daniel as a mentor, and I vastly owe my new career in software development to his mentoring and guidance!0:{"P":null,"b":"qeIKy6307sPnivCdezJSa","p":"/next-portfolio","c":["",""],"i":false,"f":[[["",{"children":["__PAGE__",{}]},"$undefined","$undefined",true],["",["$","$1","c",{"children":[[["$","link","0",{"rel":"stylesheet","href":"/next-portfolio/_next/static/css/bc27497ff85a0cad.css","precedence":"next","crossOrigin":"$undefined","nonce":"$undefined"}]],["$","html",null,{"lang":"en","children":["$","body",null,{"className":"font-mono","children":[["$","$L2",null,{}],["$","$L3",null,{"parallelRouterKey":"children","segmentPath":["children"],"error":"$undefined","errorStyles":"$undefined","errorScripts":"$undefined","template":["$","$L4",null,{}],"templateStyles":"$undefined","templateScripts":"$undefined","notFound":[[],[["$","title",null,{"children":"404: This page could not be found."}],["$","div",null,{"style":{"fontFamily":"system-ui,\"Segoe UI\",Roboto,Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif,\"Apple Color Emoji\",\"Segoe UI Emoji\"","height":"100vh","textAlign":"center","display":"flex","flexDirection":"column","alignItems":"center","justifyContent":"center"},"children":["$","div",null,{"children":[["$","style",null,{"dangerouslySetInnerHTML":{"__html":"body{color:#000;background:#fff;margin:0}.next-error-h1{border-right:1px solid rgba(0,0,0,.3)}@media (prefers-color-scheme:dark){body{color:#fff;background:#000}.next-error-h1{border-right:1px solid rgba(255,255,255,.3)}}"}}],["$","h1",null,{"className":"next-error-h1","style":{"display":"inline-block","margin":"0 20px 0 0","padding":"0 23px 0 0","fontSize":24,"fontWeight":500,"verticalAlign":"top","lineHeight":"49px"},"children":404}],["$","div",null,{"style":{"display":"inline-block"},"children":["$","h2",null,{"style":{"fontSize":14,"fontWeight":400,"lineHeight":"49px","margin":0},"children":"This page could not be found."}]}]]}]}]]],"forbidden":"$undefined","unauthorized":"$undefined"}],["$","footer",null,{"className":"bottom-0 w-full flex justify-center align-baseline border-t border-t-teal-600","children":["$","p",null,{"className":"font-mono text-slate-400 m-3 ","children":["Greener-Vigil © ",2025]}]}]]}]}]]}],{"children":["__PAGE__",["$","$1","c",{"children":[["$","div",null,{"className":"p-4 mt-3 w-full","children":["$","div",null,{"className":"sm:mt-3","children":[["$","section",null,{"className":"flex flex-wrap justify-center gap-4","children":["$","div",null,{"className":"md:w-2/5 text-white max-h-min text-center my-8 mx-auto p-4 overflow-hidden rounded-xl shadow-2xl shadow-teal-600 border-solid bg-teal-600 backdrop-blur-xl","children":[["$","h1",null,{"className":"text-3xl text-neutral-800 font-bold","children":"Daniel Greener-Vigil"}],["$","p",null,{"className":"text-ls text-neutral-900 my-2","dangerouslySetInnerHTML":{"__html":"Software Engineer | Tech Lead | Mentor"}}],["$","div",null,{"className":"flex justify-center items-baseline flex-wrap gap-3 m-4","children":[["$","a",null,{"className":"text-center text-neutral-900 border border-yellow-500 rounded-lg shadow-2xl shadow-slate-900 w-44 h-9 p-1 hover:bg-yellow-100 hover:text-slate-900","target":"_blank","rel":"noreferrer","href":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/danieljvigil/","children":"linkedin"}],["$","a",null,{"className":"text-center text-neutral-900 border border-yellow-500 rounded-lg shadow-2xl shadow-slate-900 w-44 h-9 p-1 hover:bg-yellow-100 hover:text-slate-900","target":"_blank","rel":"noreferrer","href":"https://github.com/greenervigil","children":"github"}],["$","a",null,{"target":"_blank","rel":"noreferrer","href":"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gmmq6iEGh4FPSr18xBJsINFKs_HUvfWb9hAYEjUJOgo","children":["$","button",null,{"type":"button","aria-label":"Download CV/Resume","className":"bg-yellow-500 text-slate-900 text-center rounded-lg shadow-2xl shadow-slate-900 min-w-36 h-9 px-4 hover:bg-yellow-600 hover:text-white hover:shadow-teal-500","children":"Download Resume/CV"}]}]]}]]}]}],["$","section",null,{"className":"flex flex-wrap justify-center gap-4 mx-20","children":[["$","div",null,{"className":"p-5 flex-auto basis-1/2","children":["$","div",null,{"className":"font-base","dangerouslySetInnerHTML":{"__html":"$5"}}]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"p-5 flex-auto basis-1/2","children":["$","div",null,{"className":"font-base flex flex-wrap justify-center","dangerouslySetInnerHTML":{"__html":"<p>In addition to my engineering work, I lead GreenField Development, a freelance partnership I founded to help self-taught developers accelerate their careers.
