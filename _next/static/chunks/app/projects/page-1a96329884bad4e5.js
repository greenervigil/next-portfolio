When we started working together, I didn't know a single line of code. Since then, he has helped me work my way through Javascript, React, Bootstrap, Agile methodologies, and more. He is a phenomenal mentor who adjusts his teaching and explanations well to any kind of learning preference. He provided clear and concise answers to my questions, and spent as much time as needed with me on different topics and concepts. If I could not wrap my head around something, he would find another way to explain it, or find resources to aid in my learning. He supplied me with a plethora of learning materials geared towards my preference of learning style- and spent time peer programming with me and focusing on topics I was struggling with, or had a passion to learn. He worked with me to define a capstone project that piqued my interest, and assisted in moving the project along. When I was frustrated or felt defeated, he always had the perfect approach to setting me back on track and in the right mindset. He is constantly encouraging and patient, and has dedicated a vast amount of time and resources on my learning adventure. He celebrated wholeheartedly each and every one of my 'win's with me - whether it was completing a major certificate, solving a difficult problem, finishing a project, or landing my first job. With his tutelage, after two years of learning, I accepted a Junior Developer job at a phenomenal company. Even though I'm now a full-time developer, Daniel is still there as a resource for me to reach out to when I am stuck on a problem, or need some words of advice. I would highly recommend Daniel as a mentor, and I vastly owe my new career in software development to his mentoring and guidance!"}]},d=()=>{let[e,t]=c.useState(p.projects),[a,n]=c.useState([]),o=e=>{e.preventDefault(),n([]),"All"===e.target.innerHTML?t(p.projects):(t(p.projects.filter(t=>t.tech.includes(e.target.innerHTML))),n(e.target.innerHTML))};return(0,i.jsxs)("div",{className:"flex flex-wrap justify-center",children:[(0,i.jsxs)(l.A,{children:[(0,i.jsx)("h1",{className:"font-mono text-center text-6xl mt-16",children:"Projects"}),(0,i.jsxs)("section",{className:"text-center m-5",children:[(0,i.jsx)("p",{className:"m-5",children:"Select an option to filter:"}),(0,i.jsx)("button",{className:"pointer text-sm rounded-2xl m-1 py-2 px-4 border border-yellow-500 hover:bg-yellow-100 hover:text-slate-900 shadow-2xl shadow-yellow-500",onClick:o,children:"All"}),["HTML","CSS","JavaScript","TypeScript","React","NextJS","Bootstrap","Wordpress","Tailwind CSS","Builder.io","Algolia","Jest","React Testing Library","Storybook","MUI","Storyblok","NextSEO","React Magma","Gatsby","Shadcn/ui","turborepo","Lerna","Headless Wordpress"].map(e=>(0,i.jsx)("button",{className:"pointer text-sm rounded-2xl m-1 py-2 px-4 border border-yellow-500 hover:bg-yellow-100 hover:text-slate-900 shadow-2xl shadow-yellow-500 ".concat(a.includes(e)?"bg-teal-600":""),onClick:o,children:e},e))]})]}),(0,i.jsx)("div",{className:"flex justify-center gap-3 flex-wrap max-w-5xl",children:e.map((e,t)=>(0,i.jsx)(s,{data:e},t))})]})}},81:(e,t,a)=>{"use strict";a.d(t,{A:()=>n});var i=a(5155);let n=e=>{let{children:t}=e;return(0,i.jsx)("div",{className:"p-4 mt-3 w-full",children:t})}},801:(e,t,a)=>{"use strict";a.d(t,{P:()=>i});let i="/next-portfolio"}},e=>{var t=t=>e(e.s=t);e.O(0,[565,396,441,517,358],()=>t(7771)),_N_E=e.O()}]);
